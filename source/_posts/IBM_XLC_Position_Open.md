Program changes world! Compiler changes programs!

IBM XL编译器的研发始于上世纪80年代，在业内久负盛名并拥有多位世界知名的性能专家和编程语言专家。你知道吗？ XL编译器获得过图灵奖。在二十世纪十大算法中， XL编译器是唯一的以整个软件入选（其他都是单个算法）。你知道吗？ XL编译团队走出了数位IBM院士，以及多位活跃在C/C++, OpenMP，Fortran等标准委员会的专家。你知道吗？ IBM著名的深蓝，沃森等超级计算机，其软件（如DeepQA等）都是采用了XL编译器以获得性能的飞跃！你知道吗？ XL编译器对开源世界贡献巨大 – GCC编译器有一部分核心优化代码正是由于IBM的无偿贡献，才由此奠定了GCC在性能方面开始逼近商业编译器的基础。


只要你：

- 2016年应届毕业生
- 具有计算机系等相关专业的本科，硕士及以上学历。
- CS基础（计算机体系结构，编译原理，数据结构及算法等）知识扎实
- 熟悉Linux/UNIX操作系统和开发（C/C++）
- 学习能力强，爱好接受新事物，希望长期在技术领域进行职业发展

Job description:
IBM has a long history of delivering innovative, high-quality compiler products to the marketplace. IBM compilers are designed to unleash the full power of IBM processors, including those for the different architectures shipped in industry-leading IBM Power, IBM System z, and IBM Blue Gene server system. IBM XL C/C++ and XL Fortran compilers are specifically designed to maximize the  performance and throughput of these processors, helping to optimize the performance of commercial and high-performance computing workloads.

The compiler development team in China Development Lab is working closely with the IBM Compilation Technology team in the IBM Canada Laboratory (Toronto location) to deliver new releases of C/C++ and Fortran compiler technology for Linux, AIX and zOS platforms with leading performance. We are looking for strong candidates for performance analysis, tuning and back-end development work.

Job Responsibilities:
These individuals will be working on performance analysis and tuning on multiple operating systems and architectures. They need to find the opportunity in workloads to fully exploit modern, state-of-the-art microprocessor technologies. They will also be developing back-end optimization components to implement the opportunity in the most advanced optimizing compiler back-ends in the industry. They will focus on zOS/zLinux on IBM Z System and Linux/AIX on IBM POWER architecture. Job responsibilities will include performance analysis; design and implementation of optimization algorithms as well as support and maintenance of existing compilers products in the local market.
